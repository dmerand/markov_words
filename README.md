# MarkovWords

At [EXPLO](https://www.explo.org), we often have a need for specific vocabulary-generators. For example, we might want to make a [password generator](http://lab.explo.org/password), or a Harry Potter house-generator, or some such thing.

As it turns out, [Markov Chains](http://www.thagomizer.com/blog/2017/11/07/markov-models.html) are an excellent way to create specific vocabularies by "training" a model against a set of words to determine common combinations.

While there are [quite](https://github.com/dabrorius/markov-noodles) a [few](https://github.com/dabrorius/markov-noodles) [wonderful](https://github.com/imikimi/literate_randomizer) Ruby libraries that do this, they all focus either on _actual_ English words, or on creating random _sentences_ but not words. We created this library to do the same thing, but with words, hence the name `MarkovWords`.
